# Hi, I'm Stef

I'm an industrial engineering student (field of electronics-ICT) at Ghent University and developer.
I know more languages than are appropriate to list, but currently have a job in PHP with Laravel and MySQL and some light Vue.js.
When I make a website or any web-thing, I want it to be lightweight and load quickly.

I am a Linux geek.

I play the piano.

I occasionally make music.

## Projects
I made a thing named EpPOS, developed the Kazou Games Database
and currently develop a piece of business management software with invoicing and the entire shebang.

## Blog
I have a [blog](/blog) on here as well. Take a look.
