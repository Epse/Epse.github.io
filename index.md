# Hi, I'm Stef

[Nederlandstalige versie](/nl)

I was an industrial engineering student (field of electronics-ICT) at Ghent University, now I've joined the ranks and work as a University Engineer.
I know more languages than are appropriate to list, but currently have a job in PHP with Laravel and MySQL and some light Vue.js.
When I make a website or any web-thing, I want it to be lightweight and load quickly.

I am a Linux geek.

I play the piano.

I occasionally make music.

## Pay me

Do you want to pay me for something? Want me to work for you? Have a look at [my business page](/business).

## Projects

I made a thing named EpPOS, developed the Kazou Games Database
and currently develop a piece of business management software with invoicing and the entire shebang.

## Blog

I have a [blog](/blog) on here as well. Take a look.
